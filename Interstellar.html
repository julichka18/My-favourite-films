            <p>In 2067, a global famine caused by blight has had major effects on human society, including the abandonment of scientific pursuits such as space exploration. The world's food problem has forced Joseph Cooper, an ex-NASA pilot, to work as a farmer. One day, Cooper experiences a gravitational "anomaly" in his daughter Murph's bedroom. He deduces it to be a pattern of GPS coordinates, and following it, arrives at a secret NASA facility, headed by Professor Brand.
            </p>
            <p>Brand explains to Cooper that, while NASA was publicly shut down, it continued to operate with the secret mission of discovering an extra-terrestrial planet capable of supporting human life, in the probable aftermath of extinction of earthly life due to blight. Brand claims to be working on a gravity-equation and enlists Cooper's help to pilot an exploratory spacecraft for the second part of the mission. Cooper agrees, leaving behind his children to whom he promises to return. He commands a shuttle carrying three other scientists - Romilly, Doyle, and Brandâ€™s daughter Amelia. They dock with a larger spaceship called the Endurance, and using a mysterious wormhole near Saturn, pass through to another galaxy. Their mission is to investigate three planets, orbiting a supermassive black hole called Gargantua, each of which was previously explored by a NASA scientist-explorer.
